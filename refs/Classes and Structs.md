At the end of the day, classes and structs would be pretty much the same in AnLang (the semantics from other languages do not necessarily apply). So we only use the `struct` keyword to define classes/structs.

Restrictions on classes/structs
===============================

 * Classes can either be abstract or final. Instantiable classes that can still be specialized can not exist.
