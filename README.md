AnLang-Specification
====================

Grammars, and *some* docs.

The vision behind AnLang
========================

AnLang aims to be a clutter-free language with an extensible and evolvable syntax. It enables writing software based on simple contracts not bound to explicit definitions, but on exhibited traits, for software to work across different libraries and vendors.

Features
========

Not sure whether you like them, but I certainly do:

## Quite minimal syntax

Away with semicolons, since I always forget them. Also, editors and IDEs don't autocomplete semicolons, which is annoying.

## Whitespace-unaware (for the most part)

Never again spaces vs. tabs. Or at least the compiler does not care.

## Clever generic types

Instead of specific specialised classes, we rely on conventions for types.
